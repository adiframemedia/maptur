# Welcome to Maptur
Maptur is a 3D Tracking Software and Plugin Collective that translates IMU data from mobile devices into usable 3D positioning data for animation software. Currently, it works in Blender but will soon have support in Maxon Cinema 4D, SideFX Houdini, and Autodesk Maya.

---

## How it works?
Using Maptur there's 2 main methods of control, **Live Control** and **Captured Logs**. Both methods allow users to make use of the Maptur camera tracking software whether theyâ€™re in studio on a local network or completely offline.

### Live Control
Live Control allows you to connect to your computer either via WiFi or Bluetooth in order to send IMU data to your 3D environment in real time. Within our control panel, you can make adjustments such as how you want this data to be applied, which camera it syncs the data to, or which properties you want affected by this. Along with these syncing controls, we also offer an option for smoothing to reduce jitters in the camera movement if needed.

### Captured Logs
Captured Logs are a feature that will exclusively be offered for our **Pro** users who have access to our mobile app. This app will be available on iOS first, then the Android release will follow. Utilizing this feature, you will be able to record data sets of camera information for when you're offline and then either send the file to your computer manually or wirelessly sync the data and turn it into usable keyframe data.
