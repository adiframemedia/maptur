## Welcome to Maptur

Maptur is a 3D Tracking Software and Plugin Collective that translates IMU data from mobile devices into usable 3d positioning data for animation software. Currently it works in Blender but will soon have support in Maxon Cinema 4D, SideFX Houdini, and Autodesk Maya.


### How it works?

Using Maptur there's 2 main methods of control, Live Control and Captured Logs. Live Control allows you to connect to your computer either via WiFi or Bluetooth in order to send IMU data to your 3D Environment in real time. Within our control panel you can make adjustsment such as how you want this data to be applied such as which camera it syncs the data to or which properties you want affected by this. Along with these syncing controls we also offer an option for smoothing to reduce jitters in the camera movement if needed.
